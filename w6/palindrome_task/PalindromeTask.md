# Palindrome Task


## Task

The palindrome task asks a model to decide whether a given string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. For example, "madam" is a palindrome, but "madame" is not.

For simplicity, we will not address the issue of case sensitivity so all inputs will be lowercased.
We will also not operate on any special characters which will be removed. 

## Example

Input: "madam"
Output: "true"

Input: "madame"
Output: "false"

## Dataset 

We will implement as standard pytorch dataset which generates palindromes and near palindrome strings of length k. The near palindrome strings will be generated by randomly swapping two characters in the string n times leading to a distribution of strings that are near palindromes but not exactly palindromes. The palindrome distance distribution (not only n) can be estimated emperically from the dataset. We can also vary p, the proportion of true palindromes in the dataset.

Tokenization will be from a fixed vocabulary of english letters, and the special token "pad" will be used to pad the input to the maximum length.

## Model

We will use a 3 layer, 2 headed transformer model with a fixed positional encoding, untied embeddings and ReLU activations.
We will use EasyTransformer to include hooks.
